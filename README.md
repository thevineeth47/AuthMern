# User Authentication & Authorization with JWT and RBAC

This project implements a user authentication and authorization system using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, React.js, and Redux Toolkit. It also includes CRUD API endpoints for user management and implements dynamic Role-based Access Control (RBAC) in the REST API.

## Features

- User signup (registration)
- User login (authentication)
- User logout
- CRUD API endpoints for user management
- Dynamic Role-based Access Control (RBAC) in REST API
- Secure JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing for user security

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thevineeth47/AuthMern.git
   ```

### Backend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
   - Define the following variables:
     ```
     PORT=3000
     MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
     ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following API endpoints:

- `POST /api/auth/signup`: User signup (registration)
- `POST /api/auth/signin`: User login (authentication)
- `POST /api/auth/logout`: User logout
- `GET /api/users`: Get all users (requires admin role)
- `GET /api/users/:id`: Get user by ID (requires admin role)
- `PUT /api/users/:id`: Update user by ID (requires admin role)
- `DELETE /api/users/:id`: Delete user by ID (requires admin role)

## Authentication & Authorization

- User authentication is based on JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- User roles (e.g., admin, user) are used for RBAC (Role-based Access Control) in API endpoints.
